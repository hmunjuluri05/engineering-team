Build a simple calculator application that supports:

Core Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Memory functions (store value, recall value, clear memory)
- Calculation history (view last 10 calculations)
- Support for decimal numbers
- Clear display function

Requirements:
- The calculator should prevent division by zero
- All operations should return accurate results
- The history should maintain the order of calculations
- Memory should persist during a session but clear when the application restarts

Technical Notes:
- Implement proper error handling for invalid operations
- Use a simple class-based design
- Include proper validation for user inputs
