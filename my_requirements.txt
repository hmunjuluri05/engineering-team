Build a simple task management application with the following features:

Core Features:
- Create new tasks with a title, description, and priority level (low, medium, high)
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks
- List all tasks with their status
- Filter tasks by status (completed/pending)
- Filter tasks by priority level

Requirements:
- Each task should have a unique ID
- Tasks should be stored in memory (no database required for this simple version)
- The application should validate inputs (e.g., priority must be low/medium/high)
- The application should prevent duplicate task titles
- Include proper error handling for invalid operations

Technical Notes:
- Use Python best practices with type hints and docstrings
- Keep the implementation simple and clean
- The UI should be intuitive and easy to use
